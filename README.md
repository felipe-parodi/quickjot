# QuickJot

A fast, lightweight, browser-based note-taking app that persists notes locally using localStorage.

[Try it out here.](https://felipe-parodi.github.io/quickjot/)

- Create and manage multiple notes
- Auto-saves as you type
- Notes persist in your browser
- No account needed
- No server required
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl + E to create note, Cmd/Ctrl + X to delete note
- Switch between notes using Cmd/Ctrl + Up/Down arrows
- Word count tracking
- Dark mode support

## Usage
1. Click "New Note" to create a note
2. Start typing
3. Create more notes using "New Note"
4. Switch between notes using the dropdown
5. Search notes using the search bar

## Todo
- Fix search functionality: implement dropdown results with previews
- Add markdown support for basic formatting
- Add ability to rename notes
- Add export to txt/markdown

If you prefer a simple, blank canvas, I recommend the superior [typehere.app](https://typehere.app/).
