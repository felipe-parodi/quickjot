A fast, lightweight, browser-based note-taking app that persists notes locally using localStorage.

[Try it out here.](https://felipe-parodi.github.io/quickjot/)

- Create and manage multiple notes
- Auto-saves as you type

- Note deletion confirmation with "Don't show again" option

## Usage
1. Click "New Note" to create a note and start typing
2. Create more notes using "New Note" (or CMD+E)
3. Switch between notes using the dropdown
4. Search notes using the search bar (IP)
5. Toggle markdown preview using the Preview button

## Todo

If you prefer a simple, blank canvas, I recommend the superior [typehere.app](https://typehere.app/).
