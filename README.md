# QuickJot

A fast, lightweight, browser-based note-taking app that persists notes locally using localStorage.

[Try it out:](https://felipe-parodi.github.io/quickjot/). 

- Create and manage multiple notes
- Auto-saves as you type
- Notes persist in your browser
- No account needed
- No server required

## Usage
1. Click "New Note" to create a note
2. Start typing
3. Create more notes using "New Note"
4. Switch between notes using the dropdown

If you prefer a simple, blank canvas, I recommend the superior [typehere.app](https://typehere.app/).
