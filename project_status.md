# QuickJot Project Status

## Current Implementation
- Basic note-taking functionality with multiple notes
- Local storage persistence
- Dark mode support
- Word count tracking
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - Cmd/Ctrl + E: Create new note
  - Cmd/Ctrl + X: Delete note
  - Cmd/Ctrl + Up/Down: Navigate between notes

## Recent Changes
- Added keyboard shortcuts for note navigation
- Improved textarea focus handling
- Added dark mode support
- Implemented word count feature
- Added auto-title generation from first line
- Attempted search functionality (needs fixing)

## Known Issues
1. Search functionality not working properly
   - Search box exists but results don't display
   - Need to implement proper dropdown results with previews
2. Textarea focus management could be improved
3. Note deletion has no confirmation dialog

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Fix search functionality
2. Add confirmation dialog for note deletion
3. Implement markdown support
4. Add export functionality
5. Consider data optimization for performance

## Technical Debt
- Search implementation needs complete overhaul
- Code could use better organization for features
- Some unused functions in codebase (showCommandPalette, updateStats)
- .gitignore has duplicate entries

## Future Considerations
- Data persistence optimization
- Memory management for large number of notes
- Trash/archive system for deleted notes
- Font customization options
- Note categorization system
