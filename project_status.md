# QuickJot Project Status

## Current Implementation
- Basic note-taking functionality with multiple notes
- Local storage persistence
- Dark mode support
- Word count tracking
- Note deletion confirmation with preference saving
- Markdown preview support
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - Cmd/Ctrl + E: Create new note
  - Cmd/Ctrl + X: Delete note
  - Cmd/Ctrl + Up/Down: Navigate between notes

## Recent Changes
- Added note deletion confirmation dialog with "Don't show again" option

- Fixed textarea state after note deletion
- Added keyboard shortcuts for note navigation
- Improved textarea focus handling

- Attempted search functionality (needs fixing)

## Known Issues
1. Search functionality not working properly
   - Search box exists but results don't display
   - Need to implement proper dropdown results with previews
2. Textarea focus management could be improved

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Fix search functionality
2. Add confirmation dialog for note deletion
3. Implement markdown support
4. Add export functionality
5. Consider data optimization for performance

## Technical Debt
- Search implementation needs complete overhaul
- Code could use better organization for features
- ~~Some unused functions in codebase~~ (Cleaned up unused functions)
- ~~.gitignore has duplicate entries~~ (Cleaned up and organized)

## Future Considerations
- Data persistence optimization
- Memory management for large number of notes
- Trash/archive system for deleted notes
- Font customization options
- Note categorization system
